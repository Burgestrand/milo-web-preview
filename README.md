# Web-based Milo color tool

I got fed up with Fusion 360s handling of appearances. All I want to do is to experiment with color choices for the printed parts of the Milo.

I'm ordering filament *really soon* so I wanted something *very quick and dirty* just to play around. There are loads of improvements to be done just about everywhere.
