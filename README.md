# Web-based Milo color tool

I got fed up with Fusion 360s handling of appearances. All I want to do is to experiment with color choices for the printed parts of the Milo.

I'm ordering filament *really soon* so I wanted something *very quick and dirty* just to play around. There are loads of improvements to be done just about everywhere.

* [Milo v1.5](https://github.com/MillenniumMachines/)
* [Astro](https://astro.build)

## Future ideas

* A catalogue of all printed parts.
* Ability to override color for each individual part.
* Significantly improve rendering quality.
  * It doesn't really look like the model.
  * The colors aren't necessarily representative.
* Make it easier to add filaments run-time.
* Share color choice via URL.
