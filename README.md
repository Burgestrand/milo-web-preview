# Web-based Milo color tool

I got fed up with Fusion 360s handling of appearances. All I want to do is to experiment with color choices for the printed parts of the Milo.

I'm ordering filament *really soon* so I wanted something *very quick and dirty* just to play around. There are loads of improvements to be done just about everywhere.

* [Astro](https://astro.build)

## Contributing

It's probably rather difficult to contribute to this repository due to:

* No overall plan or direction.
* Code is not all to structured to allow for paralell work.

However if you want to help out that's awesome! Feel free to contact me and we'll chat.
